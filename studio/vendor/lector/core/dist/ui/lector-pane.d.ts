/**
 * One canvas / scroll area / viewport-instance pair within a multi-pane
 * Lector layout. A `LectorPane` is the v2 split-view counterpart to the
 * canvas portion of `LectorViewer`: it owns no chrome (no toolbar, no
 * sidebar, no doctabs) — just the page rendering surface and the page
 * lifecycle that goes with it.
 *
 * `LectorShell` constructs N `LectorPane`s and provides the shared
 * chrome around them. In single-pane mode (one pane in the shell) the
 * effect is identical to a regular `LectorViewer` minus the chrome.
 *
 * **Architecture intent.** Each pane:
 *  - Creates its own `ViewportInstance` from the shared engine's viewport
 *    plugin (multi-instance API from phase 1).
 *  - Owns its own canvas + scroll area + page DOM elements.
 *  - Owns its own `PageOverlayManager` bound to its viewport instance.
 *  - Drives its own render loop reactively from `viewport.visiblePages`
 *    and `viewport.pagePositions` of its instance — not the singleton
 *    facade.
 *
 * The shared engine, document, annotation store, search results, etc.
 * mean that opening a doc once shows it in every pane that points at
 * that doc, and edits in one pane reflect in another immediately.
