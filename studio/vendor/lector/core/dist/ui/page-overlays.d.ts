/**
 * Payload of the `ui:page-mounted` engine event: the public contract for

 * region boxes, ML highlights, review marks) on top of the viewer.
 *
 * `overlayEl` is a lector-managed layer covering the page's content box
 * exactly — the host renders into it (fractional/percentage coordinates of
 * the rendered page hold under every zoom level) and never positions
 * against the viewer's internals. It is emitted when a page element starts
 * showing a `(document, pageIndex)` pair: on first mount, and again when a
 * tab switch reuses the element for a different document. The element is
 * removed with its page; `ui:page-unmounted` `{ pageIndex }` says when.
 *
 * The layer itself is `pointer-events: none`; interactive host content
 * re-enables pointer events on its own nodes.
