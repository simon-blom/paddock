# @truespar/traverse-wasm

The full [Traverse](https://truespar.com/traverse) graph engine in a
browser tab via WebAssembly. Run Cypher queries and 36+ graph-data-science
algorithms — PageRank, Louvain, Dijkstra, FastRP, etc. — entirely
in-browser, no server required. Hosted in a dedicated Web Worker so the
main thread never blocks. Persists databases to OPFS so they survive
tab reloads.

**Free for any use.** No license key, no telemetry, no upsell — the
WASM build is open for evaluation, demos, prototypes, and production.

## Install

```sh
npm install @truespar/traverse-wasm
```

Requires Node.js 18+ for the toolchain; the package itself runs in
browsers (see [Browser support](#browser-support)).

## Quickstart

### Worker and query resource contract

Operations share a bounded queue (32 active/queued requests and 256 MiB of
estimated payloads) with one physically active operation. Payloads are captured
at call time. Queue overflow rejects with `RangeError`; `db.queueStats` exposes
admission state. Exported byte buffers are transferred back without a second
worker-to-page copy. OPFS operations and queries run in order.

An `AbortSignal` removes queued work before dispatch. For an active synchronous
WASM operation, it cancels **the caller only** and reports
`AbortError.executionMayHaveCompleted === true`; the queue retains that slot
until the worker replies. It does not kill the database or promise rollback.
Query deadlines default to 10 seconds, capped at 30 seconds, and are checked
cooperatively at executor boundaries. Resumable/physically interruptible active
queries are not implemented.

Browser queries install a 128 MiB *accounted intermediate-allocation* budget;
this is not a whole-worker/RSS limit. Results return at most 10,000 rows within
an 8 MiB estimated conversion budget. `total_rows` remains the executor's full
row count; `truncated` tells callers not to treat the response as exhaustive.
Hydrated graph entities retain the 1,024-item cap and provenance hydration has
its own 8 MiB estimate. Execution is not rewritten with an injected `LIMIT`.
The executor still materializes results before response conversion; bounded
cursor/paged export is separate, unfinished work.

### Example

```ts
import { TraverseDb } from '@truespar/traverse-wasm'

// Spawn the engine (one Web Worker + the WASM module)
const db = await TraverseDb.open({ name: 'myapp' })

// Write something
await db.query(`
  CREATE (a:Person {name:'Ada'})-[:KNOWS]->(b:Person {name:'Bob'})
`)

// Read it back
const res = await db.query('MATCH (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b) RETURN a.name, b.name')
console.log(res.columns)   // ['a.name', 'b.name']
console.log(res.rows)      // [['Ada', 'Bob']]

// Persist to the browser's OPFS (survives reload)
await db.commit('myapp')

// ...later, in another tab session:
const restored = await TraverseDb.open({ name: 'myapp' })
const count = await restored.nodeCount()  // 2
```

That's the full lifecycle. The engine is the same one that ships in
the licensed server — same Cypher, same algorithms, same `.tvdb`
binary format.

## Required hosting setup: cross-origin isolation

The **single-threaded build** (`build.sh` without `--threads`) does not need
cross-origin isolation or SharedArrayBuffer and works in a non-isolated
WKWebView. The headers below apply only to the threaded build.

The engine uses `SharedArrayBuffer` for multi-threading. Browsers only
expose `SharedArrayBuffer` on pages that are **cross-origin isolated**,
which means your host must serve every page that loads `@truespar/traverse-wasm`
with these two response headers:

```
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy:   same-origin
```

Without them you'll get `ReferenceError: SharedArrayBuffer is not defined`
when calling `TraverseDb.open()`. Recipes for common hosts below — pick
the one matching your stack.

### Vite (dev + preview)

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'

export default defineConfig({
  server: {
    headers: {
      'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
      'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',
    },
  },
  preview: {
    headers: {
      'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
      'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin',
    },
  },
})
```

### Vercel

```json
// vercel.json
{
  "headers": [{
    "source": "/(.*)",
    "headers": [
      { "key": "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy", "value": "require-corp" },
      { "key": "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy", "value": "same-origin" }
    ]
  }]
}
```

### Netlify

```
# public/_headers
/*
  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

### Cloudflare Pages

```
# public/_headers (same syntax as Netlify)
/*
  Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
  Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
```

### nginx

```nginx
add_header Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp" always;
add_header Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy   "same-origin" always;
```

### Apache

```apache
Header always set Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy "require-corp"
Header always set Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy   "same-origin"
```

### IIS

```xml
<!-- web.config -->
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <httpProtocol>
      <customHeaders>
        <add name="Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy" value="require-corp" />
        <add name="Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy"   value="same-origin" />
      </customHeaders>
    </httpProtocol>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

### Test it

After deploying, open the page and check:

```js
console.log(typeof SharedArrayBuffer)  // 'function' = isolated
console.log(crossOriginIsolated)        // true
```

If either is missing, the headers didn't take effect.

## API

### `TraverseDb.open(options?)`

Spawns the worker, initializes the WASM module and thread pool, and
optionally restores an OPFS-resident database.

```ts
const db = await TraverseDb.open({
  name: 'myapp',           // optional: OPFS db to restore
  numThreads: 8,           // optional: default = min(hardwareConcurrency, 16)
  workerUrl: '/my-worker', // optional: override worker script URL
})
```

If `name` is set but no such database exists, opens empty — call
`commit(name)` later to create it.

### `db.query(cypher, params?, options?)`

```ts
const res = await db.query(
  'MATCH (n:Person) WHERE n.age > $minAge RETURN n.name, n.age',
  { minAge: 30 },
  { signal: controller.signal, timeoutMs: 5000 },
)
// res.columns: string[]
// res.rows: unknown[][]                — each cell may be a primitive,
//                                        or a tagged { _type: 'node'|'edge'|'path', ... }
// res.nodes, res.edges                 — deduplicated entities for graph rendering
// res.stats.nodes_created etc.         — write counters
// res.parsing_time_ms / planning_time_ms / execution_time_ms / time_ms
// res.query_type: 'Read'|'Write'|'ReadWrite'|'Schema'
```

`timeoutMs` installs a thread-local deadline the executor checks at
iteration boundaries. `signal` lets you AbortController-cancel from
the main thread (the worker also receives the cancellation).

### `db.algorithms()`

Returns the live GDS catalog — every algorithm with its supported
modes, required/optional config, and output schema. Use this to drive
a UI catalog or to introspect what's runnable:

```ts
const { algorithms } = await db.algorithms()
for (const a of algorithms) {
  console.log(`${a.name}: modes=${a.modes.join('/')} — ${a.description}`)
}
```

Then invoke any of them with regular Cypher:

```ts
await db.query(`
  CALL traverse.pageRank.write({writeProperty: 'rank', maxIterations: 20})
  YIELD nodeCount, mean, computeMillis
  RETURN nodeCount, mean, computeMillis
`)
```

### `db.schema()`

Returns labels, relationship types, property keys (with types), and
the per-label / per-edge-type property listings. Mirrors the HTTP
`/api/schema` response.

### `db.importCypher(text)`

Run a multi-statement Cypher import script. Returns per-statement
results plus aggregate stats. Same shape as the licensed server's
`/api/import` endpoint.

### Persistence

```ts
await db.commit('myapp')                       // → OPFS
const list = await db.listDatabases()          // → [{name, size, lastModified}]
await db.load('myapp')                          // ← OPFS
await db.deleteDatabase('myapp')

const bytes = await db.exportTvdb()             // → Uint8Array (.tvdb format)
await db.loadTvdb(bytes)                        // ← Uint8Array

await db.writeBytes('upload', uploadedFile)    // write straight to OPFS, then load() separately
```

The `.tvdb` format is identical to the one the licensed server reads
and writes — you can `db.exportTvdb()` in the browser, save the bytes,
and `Database::open` the same file from a server-side embedded binding.

### Static helpers

```ts
await TraverseDb.listDatabases()                // OPFS list without opening a TraverseDb
await TraverseDb.deleteDatabase('myapp')        // delete without opening
```

### Cleanup

```ts
db.close()    // terminates the worker; pending requests reject with AbortError
```

---

## OPFS persistence

The package writes databases to the browser's
[Origin Private File System](https://web.dev/articles/origin-private-file-system) —
a sandboxed filesystem visible only to your origin. It is:

- Persistent across tab reloads and browser restarts
- Subject to the browser's storage quota (typically gigabytes)
- Not visible from other origins or via DevTools as a regular filesystem
- Wiped when the user clears site data

To check available quota:

```ts
const { quota, usage } = await navigator.storage.estimate()
console.log(`OPFS: ${usage} / ${quota} bytes`)
```

---

## TypeScript

The package ships full `.d.ts` files. Your editor should autocomplete
everything (`QueryResponse`, `GdsAlgorithm`, etc.). Strict-mode safe.

```ts
import { TraverseDb, type QueryResponse, type GdsAlgorithm } from '@truespar/traverse-wasm'
```

## Browser support

| Browser | Minimum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Chrome / Edge | 92+ | Full support |
| Firefox | 89+ | Full support |
| Safari | 16.4+ | Full support; iOS has tight memory caps (see below) |

Hard requirements (all browsers):

- `SharedArrayBuffer` (gated by COEP/COOP headers — see above)
- `WebAssembly.Memory` with `shared: true`
- OPFS (`navigator.storage.getDirectory`) for persistence

**iOS Safari memory.** Phones cap WebAssembly memory at roughly 300–500
MiB, much lower than desktop's ~4 GiB. Plan dataset sizes accordingly.

---

## Bundle size & runtime memory

- **Wire size**: ~1.4 MB gzipped (~4.2 MB unpacked, mostly the WASM
  binary itself)
- **Linear-memory ceiling**: ~4 GiB on desktop (wasm32 hard cap);
  ~300–500 MiB on iOS Safari. Memory64 raises the ceiling to ~16 GiB
  on Chrome 133+ / Firefox 134+ but isn't yet enabled in this build.
- **Boot time**: typically 200–600 ms on desktop, 1–3 s on mobile

The engine streams the WASM module on `TraverseDb.open()`. Subsequent
`open()` calls reuse the browser's WASM cache.
