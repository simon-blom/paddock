// The document COLUMN: in document mode the main area is
// divided into columns and the first one is the document. PDFs render in
// lector's full viewer  - its toolbar, search, thumbnail
// sidebar and DOCUMENT TABS: every PDF in the conversation opens in the one
// viewer through its document manager, and lector's own tab bar switches
// them. The pane's strip survives only for image documents, which the PDF
// viewer cannot show. The viewer chrome is trimmed for the chat column: no
// file menu (open/print/security), no annotation modes - thumbnails,
// toolbar and tabs are what matter here.
//
// WORD documents render here too, through scriptor. They
// used to be the one format still opening in a modal, so "open the document"
// meant two different things depending on the file you clicked. Same bargain
// as lector's: the pane is the entry point, the dialog is only for formats
// nothing in-app can render. scriptor ships no toolbar of its own (its
// `Viewer` is bare pages), so the pane draws one - the same fold / zoom /
// download set lector gets, in the same place.
//
// PHOTOS finish the migration. A picture in any chat now
// opens here too, which was the last format still answering a click with a
// dialog - two of them, in fact, stacked on one tile: a lightbox for the
// pixels and a second window behind an eye button for "Model metadata".
// Both are gone. The pane already had the zoom the lightbox never did, and the
// honesty panel becomes a TAB beside the picture rather than a window over it.
//
// FILE DETAILS is the second tab of that kind:
// everything the file says about itself, which on a photo is 121 fields
// against the 3 the prompt takes. It also settles where the strip goes. The
// strip used to go only to documents with pictures, because a lone Word document
// had exactly one secondary view and the bar's eye button covered it; with two
// there is nothing left of that argument, so every document the pane draws its
// own bar for now carries a strip. lector stays the exception it always was -
// a host row above its toolbar is a second row of chrome - so
// its documents keep one toolbar button that opens both views in a dialog.
//
// SELECTION = TARGET, synced both ways with lector: a lector tab click moves
// the conversation's activeDocId (the composer chips follow), and a newly
// sent document activates its lector tab. Never by scroll.
//
// The OCR overlay rides lector's host-overlay contract (ui:page-mounted /
// ui:page-unmounted engine events): lector hands us one layer per live page
// element, covering the page's content box exactly, and the boxes teleport
// into it - percentage geometry, so lector's zoom holds for free.
