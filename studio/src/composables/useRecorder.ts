// Record a clip, hand back a file. Nothing else.
//
// The other microphone path (`useMicTranscribe`) opens a realtime socket per
// armed lane and pushes the same PCM to all of them, so two models transcribe
// the identical audio as it is spoken. That is the better comparison when it
// is available - and it is available only against LOCAL runners: no provider
// takes a socket, so a cloud speech model can only ever hear a finished file
//
// So this is the second mode, and it is deliberately its own path rather than
// a flag inside the live one: with no lanes to feed there is no capture graph,
// no resample, no worklet, no per-lane backlog - just MediaRecorder. Keeping
// them apart means the record mode cannot regress the live one, which has cost
// two bugs of its own already.
//
// What comes out is an ordinary File, which is the point: it goes into the
// composer's tray and sends down the exact path a dragged clip takes, so every
// lane - local and cloud alike - hears the same recording.
//
// The MICROPHONE is not AWAKE when getUserMedia RESOLVES. Measured:
// a clip recorded straight after the promise settled began with
// 0.90 s of exact zeros - not a quiet ramp, digital silence - and the words
// spoken into that hole were simply not in the file. Chrome hands over a live
// track and fills it with silence while the capture device actually opens.
// So we do not start the recorder, start the clock, or tell the user we are
// listening until a non-zero sample has come through. It cannot recover speech
// the device never delivered, but it stops the composer inviting you to talk
// into a microphone that is not on yet, which is the same "no silent failures"
// rule the rest of the product follows.
