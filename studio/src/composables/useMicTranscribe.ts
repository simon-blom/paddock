// Talk into the page: a live microphone transcription session,
// fanned out to N models at once.
//
// Wraps the runner's `/v1/realtime?intent=transcription` socket - OpenAI's own
// realtime transcription dialect. One microphone, one capture graph, one
// resample, and the same PCM chunks pushed to every armed lane, so two models
// transcribe the identical audio and their transcripts race side by side. That
// is the comparison a recording could never make honestly: same words, same
// room, same moment.
//
// The socket goes through the manager (`/api/runners/{port}/v1/realtime`) for
// the reason every other runner call does: the browser never opens a runner
// port itself, so runner API keys stay server-side and there is no
// cross-origin question. The manager relays frames without reading them.
//
// PARTIALS do not FLICKER, and that is a server property, not a UI trick: the
// runner commits a word only once two consecutive passes over the growing
// audio agree on it (LocalAgreement-2), so what arrives here only ever grows.
// This file therefore appends deltas and never rewrites - if it ever needed to
// rewrite, the promise would already be broken upstream.
//
// The UNIT is the UTTERANCE, not the recording. The session runs
// server VAD, so a pause closes an utterance and the runner answers it with a
// `completed` carrying segments, word times and confidence - the same object
// the file endpoint returns for that audio. A lane is therefore a LIST of
// finalised items plus the one still being spoken, and both callers read it
// that way: dictation inserts each item as it lands, the compare view makes a
// row of it.
//
// Which is also why the boundaries can be trusted to line up across lanes.
// The runner's detector is a pure function of the sample stream and every lane
// gets byte-identical frames (see `flush`), so utterance N is the same audio in
// every column - no clock lane, no negotiation. `at` is asserted rather than
// assumed anyway: a lane that disagrees about where its item started is a lane
// whose column cannot be compared, and saying so beats rendering it.
