//! Everything the transcription lanes know about LANGUAGE: naming a code,
//! reading a language back out of finished text, and assembling the one
//! object every response reports it all through.
//!
//! ## Why this exists at all
//!
//! A wrong language is not a labelling mistake on this class of model - it is
//! a silent TRANSLATION. Told to expect the wrong language, a whisper-family
//! model stops transcribing and starts translating, and what comes back is
//! fluent, grammatical and wrong with no ragged edge to notice. Measured:
//! Swedish speech, `language` left to detect, and
//! Qwen3-ASR answered *"Hallo, ich teste und sehe, wie es funktioniert."* -
//! correct German for what was said in Swedish.
//!
//! Under the no-silent-failures principle that has to be caught and said out
//! loud, and the runner is the only party that can: it holds the language the
//! decode was told to expect AND the text that came out, at the same moment.
//! A client cannot do it without a second round trip, and doing it client-side
//! would mean the UI inventing a fact the API never returned.
//!
//! ## What is measured, and what is only reported
//!
//! Two different signals share this module and must not be confused:
//!
//!   * the AUDIO language - the model's own posterior over its language
//!     tokens (whisper), or the language a generative lane names in its
//!     answer. That is the engine's, and it arrives here already decided.
//!   * the TEXT language - what the finished transcript is actually written
//!     in, from character n-grams. That is this module's, and it is the only
//!     independent check available: it needs no second model, no audio and no
//!     GPU, and it works on lanes that have no language detection at all.
//!
//! The check REPORTS. It never rewrites `language`, never re-runs a decode,
//! and never relabels a transcript - a detector that silently corrects is a
//! second silent failure wearing the first one's clothes.
