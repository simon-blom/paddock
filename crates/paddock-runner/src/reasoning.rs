//! What reasoning control the served checkpoint actually implements -
//! MEASURED from its own chat template at load, not assumed from its family.
//!
//! Why this is not a table. Qwen3.8-27B grades
//! reasoning effort at low/medium/xhigh; Qwen3.6-27B and Qwen3.5-9B have only
//! an on/off `enable_thinking`. All three report `general.architecture =
//! qwen35` and all three parse as `Dialect::QwenXml`, so neither of the two
//! identities the runner keys on can tell them apart. Anything hand-written -
//! an arch row, a dialect arm - is guaranteed to be wrong for one of them, and
//! it was: every 3.8 request collapsed to `enable_thinking: true` and the
//! ladder was unreachable.
//!
//! The template is the contract, so the template is what we ask. Templates come
//! in two shapes and the probe distinguishes them by rendering a sentinel value
//! no real ladder contains:
//!
//! - **Validating** (Qwen3.8): the template enumerates what it accepts and
//!   `raise_exception`s on anything else. The sentinel raises, so the accepted
//!   set is knowable exactly - render each candidate level and keep the ones
//!   that survive. This is the authority: it is the shipped artifact's own
//!   declaration, and it cannot drift from the file we are serving.
//! - **Interpolating** (gpt-oss, Muse Glimmer): the value goes straight into
//!   the prompt text (`"Reasoning: " + reasoning_effort`), so any string
//!   renders and probing would happily report a seven-rung ladder for a model
//!   trained on three. There the real vocabulary lives in the model card, which
//!   is what `Dialect::effort_kwarg` already holds with its citation - so that
//!   table stays, scoped to exactly the case where measurement cannot answer.
//!
//! The DEFAULT rung is always measured, both shapes alike: render with the
//! variable unset and see which rung's render it equals. That is how the
//! checkpoint's published default (Qwen3.8 xhigh, gpt-oss medium, Muse high)
//! reaches the wire instead of a house value - the same principle as the
//! elected sampling profiles in `paddock_models::sampling`.
