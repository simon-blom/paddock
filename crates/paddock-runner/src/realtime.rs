//! `GET /v1/realtime?intent=transcription` - the OpenAI Realtime TRANSCRIPTION
//! session over WebSocket: audio arrives while it is still being spoken and
//! text comes back as it is recognised (microphone half).
//!
//! ## Why this wire and not one of our own
//!
//! Streaming a FILE is `/v1/audio/transcriptions` with `stream=true` - one
//! request, one answer, deltas along the way. A microphone is the other
//! direction too: the request has no end until the speaker stops, so it cannot
//! be a POST body. OpenAI already defines that shape, and clients already
//! speak it, so conforming costs nothing and inventing costs everyone.
//!
//! Client -> server: `session.update`, `input_audio_buffer.append`,
//! `input_audio_buffer.commit`, `input_audio_buffer.clear`, and Paddock's
//! ordered Stop barrier `input_audio_buffer.drain` (advertised in capabilities).
//! Server -> client: `session.created` / `session.updated`,
//! `conversation.item.input_audio_transcription.delta` / `.completed`,
//! `input_audio_buffer.committed` / `.cleared`, and `error`.
//!
//! ## The policy: LocalAgreement-2, and why not AlignAtt
//!
//! Whisper's encoder is a FIXED 30 s window - you cannot feed it 200 ms and
//! ask for text. So a streaming policy is not optional plumbing, it is the
//! feature: something has to decide which words are safe to SHOW, given that
//! the model will happily invent an ending for audio that has not been spoken
//! yet, then change its mind when it has.
//!
//! Two policies own this literature.
//!
//! **LocalAgreement-2** (Liu et al. 2020; whisper_streaming, Macháček et al.
//! 2023) re-transcribes a growing buffer and commits only the longest prefix
//! that two CONSECUTIVE passes agree on. It needs nothing from the model but
//! its output, which is why it is what this file implements.
//!
//! **AlignAtt** (Papi et al. 2023; Simul-Whisper, Interspeech 2024;
//! SimulStreaming, MIT) is the better one, and is the 2025 state of the art:
//! it reads the decoder's CROSS-ATTENTION and stops emitting at the first
//! token whose most-attended audio frame lands within a threshold of the end
//! of the buffer - i.e. it detects "this word is guessing about audio I have
//! not heard" directly, instead of inferring it from two passes disagreeing.
//! It is both lower-latency and cheaper (one pass, not one per second).
//!
//! We ship LocalAgreement-2 KNOWINGLY, and the reason is worth writing down
//! because it decides the order of two tasks: AlignAtt needs materialized
//! cross-attention scores out of the decoder, and our flash-decoding kernel
//! does not produce them - which is the same engine door needs for
//! word-level timestamps (whisper's DTW alignment reads the same weights).
//! One door, two features. Until it opens, the second-best policy is the best
//! available one; when it opens, this file gets AlignAtt and the other gets its
//! timings from the same tensor.
//!
//! ## What `completed` is, and what it is not
//!
//! Two promises, and the second follows from the first. The deltas
//! CONCATENATE to the completed transcript - a client that appends every
//! delta ends up holding exactly what the terminal event says, the same
//! guarantee `/v1/audio/transcriptions?stream=true` makes, so neither
//! streaming surface needs a client to know which one it is talking to.
//!
//! Which means `completed` is not the same thing as transcribing the whole
//! utterance in one go. It is the committed prefix plus the final pass's
//! tail, and the committed prefix was decided from SHORTER buffers. When the
//! model's hypothesis changes as it hears more - and it does; see the language
//! note in the decode loop - the live answer keeps what it already showed
//! rather than rewriting it. Never retracting a word is what a delta stream
//! buys, and this is what it costs.
//!
//! Revision-aware clients may explicitly request `paddock_final_revision`
//! (advertised as `realtime_transcription.final_revision`). Their terminal
//! `transcript` is the final utterance hypothesis, with `paddock_revised` true
//! when it corrects the provisional deltas. Native/web Studio negotiate this
//! mode so stored text and final word timestamps describe the same decode.
//! The existing final pass is reused; no whole-recording second transcription.
//! Other clients retain the original append-only contract by default.
//!
//! ## The utterance is the unit of finality
//!
//! `completed` used to carry text and nothing else - no segment times, no word
//! times, no per-word confidence - so a turn committed straight from a live
//! session was a second-class record next to a dropped-file turn, and the
//! Studio worked around it by transcribing the recording a SECOND time through
//! the file endpoint and storing that instead. You watched a transcript form
//! and then it was replaced wholesale by a different one, with nothing saying
//! so.
//!
//! The fix is not a better whole-file pass at the end, it is noticing that the
//! boundary is already here. A closed utterance already runs a final pass - the
//! one whose answer is authoritative rather than a hypothesis - so that is
//! where the richer decode belongs. `paddock_verbose` on `completed` is the
//! exact object the file endpoint's `verbose_json` returns for that utterance's
//! audio, and it costs no extra decode.
//!
//! What that buys, and it is the whole argument for utterance-level finality:
//! cost scales with SPEECH rather than with recording length, so a forty-minute
//! session is never re-transcribed to settle, and it settles as it goes instead
//! of all at once at the end. whisper.cpp's `stream` reaches the same shape
//! from the other direction - its VAD mode emits a bounded block per utterance
//! and that block is the one that carries timestamps
//! (`params.no_timestamps = !use_vad`), while its sliding-window mode rewrites
//! a provisional line and asks for no times at all.
//!
//! Two things it is careful about. Timestamps are a SESSION property, not a
//! final-pass one: they change the decode prompt, and LocalAgreement compares
//! each pass against the one before it, so flipping them at the boundary would
//! make the final pass disagree with its own hypotheses for no reason but the
//! prompt. Word timing (a second forward pass per window, the DTW alignment) is
//! final-pass only - that is the cost this file refused to pay when it ran
//! every pass with `false, false`, and at a closed utterance it is paid once.
//!
//! It is opt-in because of what it costs and because of what it changes:
//! dictation never shows word times, and the timestamp prompt is exactly what
//! some fine-tunes condition their no-speech refusal on.
//!
//! ## Server VAD: who decides an utterance is over
//!
//! `turn_detection: {type: "server_vad"}` hands the turn boundary to the
//! server, which is what a hands-free microphone needs - nobody presses a
//! button to say they stopped talking. The detector itself is
//! `paddock_engine::audio::vad` (read its header for what it is and what the
//! state of the art is); this file owns what the API means by a turn:
//!
//! - `threshold` picks how far above the room a frame must sit,
//! - `prefix_padding_ms` is how much audio before the first speech frame the
//!   utterance keeps - and, while nobody is speaking, exactly how much audio
//!   this session holds at all,
//! - `silence_duration_ms` is how long the quiet has to last before the turn
//!   ends,
//! - `idle_timeout_ms` announces a session where nobody said anything.
//!
//! Two properties fall out of it that are worth naming. Passes only run while
//! someone is SPEAKING, so an open microphone in an empty room costs nothing
//! and - more importantly - whisper is never handed a buffer of silence to
//! hallucinate over. And the buffer stops being a cap-until-you-commit: audio
//! before speech is dropped down to the prefix padding, so `MAX_BUFFER_S` now
//! bounds one continuous utterance instead of one forgotten session.
//!
//! With `turn_detection: null` - still the default, and what OpenAI's own
//! whisper-backed realtime model requires - none of this runs and the client
//! ends utterances with `input_audio_buffer.commit`.
//!
//! ## Buffer trimming, and why it needs no timestamps
//!
//! Every pass re-transcribes the whole buffer, so a long utterance would pay
//! for its own past over and over - and worse, whisper's last window would
//! grow ever emptier, which is where it hallucinates.
//!
//! whisper_streaming solves this by trimming at a completed SEGMENT, which
//! means asking the model for timestamps and parsing them. We do not have to:
//! our passes cut the buffer into whisper's own 30 s windows from the start,
//! windows never attend across each other, and a COMPLETE window's mel is
//! byte-identical on every later pass. So the first window's transcript stops
//! being a hypothesis the moment a second window exists - a free, exact
//! boundary where the reference implementation has to hunt for one.
//!
//! When that happens the session retires that window's words (anything in
//! there still uncommitted goes out first - nothing can revise it once its
//! audio is gone), drops its 30 s of audio, and hands its TEXT to the next
//! pass as `<|startofprev|>` context. That second half is what keeps quality:
//! trimming alone would throw away the context that made the next window good.
//! The caller's own `prompt` rides in front of it, and the engine keeps the
//! tail when the two together outgrow whisper's half-context budget.
//!
//! ## Two lanes, one policy
//!
//! LocalAgreement-2 needs nothing from the model but its output, so the whole
//! session above is model-agnostic and only the pass differs: whisper decodes
//! fixed 30 s windows on its own thread, while Qwen3-ASR and granite-speech
//! take the whole buffer as one multimodal prompt on the ordinary engine.
//! Both run here.
//!
//! Two things follow from that difference, and both are the generative lanes'
//! shape rather than a gap in this file. There is no finished-window boundary
//! on them, so nothing to TRIM at - the buffer stays bounded by server VAD and
//! the session cap instead. And the caller's `prompt` reaches them as an
//! INSTRUCTION rather than a spelling hint (on those families the field is the
//! task), which is why the retired transcript is never handed to them: asking
//! a model to follow the words it just transcribed is not context, it is a
//! command.
