//! `GET /api/attachments/{id}/rendition` - a viewable JPEG of a photo the
//! browser cannot decode itself.
//!
//! Like the metadata twin next door, the point is what the setup leaves out:
//! no runner, no model, no GPU. A photo has to preview on a cloud chat with
//! nothing loaded, so nothing here starts anything.
//!
//! These assert UNCONDITIONALLY. An earlier version accepted "no decoder
//! installed" as a pass on every case, which meant a machine without the
//! native pack showed green tests that had decoded nothing. There is no pack
//! now - rav1d is linked in - so there is no such state and no branch to hide
//! in. HEIC's refusal is asserted just as firmly, because it is permanent
//! rather than conditional.
//!
//! Fixtures are the ones paddock-heif tests with, reached across the crate
//! boundary rather than copied: duplicating them would let the two suites
//! drift onto different files while claiming to test the same decode.
// Test code: a failed assumption stops the test where it happened.
