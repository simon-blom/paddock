//! Model registry + download engine. The set of models a paddock build can pull
//! is a **compiled-in manifest** (`models.toml`, embedded via `include_str!`), so
//! a release only ever offers models it was built to load - compatibility is by
//! construction: if a model is in this release's manifest, it works with this
//! release. There is no remote catalog to fetch or keep in sync; the origin
//! (Cloudflare R2) is a dumb file host, and each manifest entry carries the file's
//! stable URL, sha256 and size.
//!
//! The puller itself is fast: parallel HTTP-Range segments, resumable (a sidecar
//! segment map), SHA-256-verified, atomic temp->rename. Origin-agnostic - any host
//! with Range support works; a non-Range origin falls back to a single stream. The
//! browser never downloads - the server pulls to disk, where models load from.
