//! Is there a newer paddock, and can we trust the copy we fetched.
//!
//! ## Why the truespar API and not our own origin
//!
//! Models, the CUDA runtime and kernel packs come from R2 because they are big,
//! hardware-matched, and hash-pinned at build time. The APP is none of those
//! things, and the release API already carries two things a static manifest
//! cannot: RELEASE NOTES (the "what's new" the UI wants) and publish/unpublish
//! (a bad release can be pulled centrally). Its read path is public - verified
//! in truespar-core: `get_latest` and `download_latest` take no AuthPrincipal
//! while create/upload/publish do - so the account-free promise holds.
//!
//! ## The hash is optional deliberately
//!
//! `sha256` was added to the API for us (truespar-core migration 0011, computed
//! server-side while streaming the upload, so it is the hash of what the API
//! actually stored rather than what a publisher claimed). Rows uploaded before
//! that column existed return null, and will forever.
//!
//! So it is `Option<String>` and the rule is: VERIFY when PRESENT, SAY so when
//! ABSENT. Never silently trust. An update is the one download that replaces the
//! program itself, and TLS protects the transport, not a bad upload or a
//! compromised bucket - `cuda_setup` already refuses to half-install on a hash
//! mismatch and this path should not be the softer one.
//!
//! ## Checking is not installing
//!
//! This module only ANSWERS the question. It deliberately does not swap
//! anything: on Windows a running exe cannot be overwritten, and per the
//! "the maintainer starts services" rule a manager must never restart itself behind the
//! user's back. Download and apply is a separate, opt-in step.
