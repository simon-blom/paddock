//! Artifacts - the manager's own first-party MCP server.
//!
//! An artifact is substantial standalone content the model wrote and the user
//! keeps: a page, a chart, a document. It lives in the Studio's side panel,
//! not in the message flow, and it is VERSIONED - "make the header blue" three
//! turns later appends v2 rather than starting over.
//!
//! ## Why this is an MCP server and not a runner built-in
//!
//! The store is the manager's SQLite (the only DB on the box) and runners are
//! stateless, so the tools have to execute where the data is. Hosting them as
//! an MCP server means both lanes reach them through machinery that already
//! exists: a local model goes runner -> `paddock-mcp` -> here, and a cloud model
//! goes `cloud_loop` -> here. No new tool-execution path anywhere, and the
//! Studio renders the calls with the `mcp_call` cards it already has.
//!
//! The runner needs zero changes for this: `paddock-mcp` already speaks
//! Streamable HTTP with custom headers, so we are just another URL.
//!
//! ## Why the Studio attaches it per request instead of configuring it
//!
//! These tools ride as an INLINE `mcp` tool on each request (the shape
//! `resolve_mcp_server` already parses), never as an entry in
//! `servers/<port>.toml`. If a runner advertised `artifact_create` to every
//! caller, a Claude Code session or a curl client would have the model call
//! it, the content would land here, and the caller would get back
//! `art_7f3a...` - a reference to something it has no panel to render. That is
//! a silent failure, and it would also make a standalone runner depend on the
//! manager being up. Inline-per-request keeps the capability exactly where the
//! surface to show it exists.
//!
//! ## The context rule
//!
//! The conversation carries the OPERATIONS; the body stays here. `update`
//! answers "replaced 4 lines with 6", never the new content - echoing it would
//! put the whole artifact back in the prompt and defeat the entire point.
//! `artifact_read` exists so the model can pull a body back deliberately when
//! it actually needs to see one again.
//!
//! ## Editing semantics
//!
//! `update` takes an exact string that must match exactly ONCE. That is the
//! convergent industry design (Claude's artifacts); OpenAI's canvas shipped
//! regex patching and then instructed the model to always full-rewrite code
//! documents, which is the falsified branch. `rewrite` is the escape hatch for
//! changes too broad to express as a replacement.

pub const INSTRUCTIONS: &str = "Artifacts are pieces of content shown in a panel beside the conversation, where \
                 the user can view and iterate on them. When the user ASKS YOU TO PRODUCE an \
                 HTML page, chart, diagram, SVG, document or program, put it in an artifact \
                 rather than a fenced code block in your reply - anything over roughly 15 lines \
                 belongs there. \"Simple\" or \"small\" describes the content, not where it goes. \
                 Answering a question is not producing a document: a description, an explanation \
                 or an analysis goes in the reply, however long it runs. And never draw your own \
                 picture of something this app already renders - a fenced block the app turns \
                 into a view, a `map` block for one, is part of the reply and must not be moved \
                 into an artifact or redrawn as one. \
                 Do not repeat an artifact's content in your message; say briefly what you made. \
                 An artifact renders with NO network access, so a remote image, font or script \
                 will not appear - draw with CSS/SVG, or embed the bytes as a data: URI. Never \
                 link a placeholder image service; several are dead, and the page renders wrong \
                 rather than empty. \
                 Content is not echoed back into the chat, so read it back when you need the \
                 exact text. Earlier tool calls are NOT in the transcript, so when the user asks \
                 to change something, find its id first rather than creating a second copy. \
                 The tools, with their arguments: \
                 artifact_create(kind, title, content, language?) - kind is one of html, \
                 markdown, svg, mermaid, code, csv (rendered as a table), graph, text. A written \
                 document is markdown; html is for a page you actually wrote tags for. \
                 A GRAPH OF DATA - entities and their relationships (people, cities, \
                 companies, anything the user may want to query or explore) - is ALWAYS \
                 kind graph: an openCypher script of CREATE statements the app runs in a \
                 live, queryable graph view. This holds however casually it is asked \
                 (\"make a graph of this\"). mermaid is ONLY for diagrams of processes \
                 and flows, never for data. Put real property values in graph artifacts, \
                 not placeholders, and separate CREATE clauses with newlines - never \
                 semicolons - so node variables stay shared for the relationship clauses. \
                 Relationships connect NODE VARIABLES on both ends - (a)-[:REL]->(b) where \
                 b was CREATEd as a node - never a bare string: make the thing a node \
                 (CREATE a Portfolio node with a name property) and point at it. \
                 Every relationship is DIRECTED - always write the arrow, \
                 (a)-[:REL]->(b) or (a)<-[:REL]-(b); an arrowless -[:REL]- fails the \
                 whole import. Do not add summary or legend nodes - the graph itself \
                 is the summary. A property map matches ONE literal value per key - OR \
                 inside braces is not Cypher; to wire several nodes at once, MATCH with \
                 a WHERE filter (m.role IN ['a', 'b']) and CREATE from those variables, \
                 which also works across CREATE and MATCH clauses in the same script. \
                 One relationship per clause: (a, b, c)-[:R]->(x) is not Cypher, and every \
                 clause must start with a keyword (CREATE or MATCH) - a bare pattern line \
                 fails the whole import. Declare each node variable ONCE with its braces; \
                 every later mention is BARE - (a)-[:R]->(germany), never \
                 (a)-[:R]->(germany with braces again) - re-CREATEing a bound variable \
                 with properties fails the import. Every line copies this shape EXACTLY \
                 (variable, colon, Label, properties - the colon is required): \
                 CREATE (ana:Person {name: 'Ana', role: 'CEO'}) \
                 CREATE (acme:Company {name: 'Acme'}) \
                 CREATE (ana)-[:WORKS_AT {since: 2020}]->(acme) \
                 - a fresh variable per node, one CREATE per line, arrow on every \
                 relationship; \
                 artifact_list() - the id, title and version of everything in this conversation; \
                 artifact_read(artifact_id, version?) - the current text, or an older version; \
                 artifact_update(artifact_id, old_string, new_string) - old_string must appear \
                 exactly once; \
                 artifact_rewrite(artifact_id, content) - replace the whole body. \
                 These are listed here in full because your visible tool list may not carry \
                 their schemas: if a name is missing from it, call mcp_search_tools with \
