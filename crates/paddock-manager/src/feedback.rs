//! "Send feedback" - the Studio's dialog, forwarded to the truespar API.
//!
//! ## Why the manager forwards instead of the browser posting directly
//!
//! The Studio could `fetch()` `api.truespar.com` itself, and traverse's WASM
//! build does exactly that because it has no server to forward through. We do,
//! and going through it is strictly better: the manager is already the only
//! thing here that talks to that host (`updates.rs`), so there is one place
//! where outbound calls live and one place to read to find out what leaves the
//! box. It also sidesteps CORS entirely - the Studio is served from
//! `localhost:<port>`, which has no business being on anybody's allow-list.
//!
//! ## The context blob is assembled here, deliberately
//!
//! Traverse's panel assembles its "attach last query" payload in the browser.
//! We don't, for two reasons. The manager is the only process that actually
//! knows all of it (the GPU probe, the fleet, the build stamp), and - the real
//! reason - `GET /api/feedback/context` returns the same struct the POST
//! attaches. The preview the user approves is not a rendering of what we will
//! send; it is what we will send. A preview that can drift from the payload is
//! how a promise about telemetry quietly stops being true.
//!
//! ## What must never end up in here
//!
//! Runner config carries an inference `api_key` AND a `web_search_api_key`, and
//! a model can be spawned by absolute path - so a naive `serde_json::to_value`
//! of a `RunnerConfig` would ship two secrets and a user's directory layout to
//! a server. [`Context`] is therefore built field by field from an explicit
//! allow-list, never by serialising an existing struct. Keep it that way: the
//! failure mode of adding a field is silent.
