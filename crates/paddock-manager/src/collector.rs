//! The manager-side collector: one discovery loop that keeps, per live runner
//! INSTANCE, an event-ring subscriber (§8.1, `activity` rows) and a metrics
//! scraper (`usage_*` rows) - plus the lifecycle
//! bookkeeping both tiers hang off: `service_generation` bands opened when a
//! generation is first seen and closed when it vanishes, and `usage_gap` rows
//! wherever the record has a hole (a blind manager window, an unobserved
//! restart, an overrun ring).
//!
//! Instances are keyed by their per-process-start UUID from identify
//! - the load-bearing identity; pid and started_at only corroborate.
//!   Keying on (port, started_at) collided when two generations started inside
//!   one second, and the second generation's records were silently discarded.
//!
//! Retention is a stated knob (`activity_retention_days`, purged hourly);
//! the 5-minute usage grain keeps a fixed ~90 days (hourly grain is forever,
//! ~13 MB/yr). Persistence has its own switch (`activity` mode): `full` runs
//! both tiers, `aggregates` runs only the metrics tier (counts without
//! content), `off` runs neither - not recording is a first-class
//! configuration.
