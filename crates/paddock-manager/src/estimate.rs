//! `/api/models/estimate` - honest will-it-fit for the whole catalog at once.
//!
//! The models page needs a VRAM figure per row, and the only figure worth
//! showing is one derived from the actual file. So this endpoint answers for
//! every catalog model in one request, at a caller-supplied (or
//! server-default) concurrency, and says plainly which rows it could not
//! measure rather than inventing a number for them.
//!
//! Context is an OUTPUT, not a parameter: each model's trained window and the
//! cache the card can afford decide it together, so the response carries both
//! the value and a whole `curve` of it against concurrency.
//!
//! Geometry comes from `paddock_models::probe` (bounded header read, never the
//! weights) and the arithmetic from `paddock_estimator`. Nothing here does math
//! of its own - a second copy of the KV formula is exactly how the old
//! `total_size * 1.2 + 1 GB` guess drifted 2.8× away from reality.
