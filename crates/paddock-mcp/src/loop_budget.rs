//! The agent loop's budget - what stops a loop that has stopped working.
//!
//! Making a bad tool call cheap did nothing about the loop spending eight
//! rounds discovering that it was bad. Observed live on gpt-5.6: four dead
//! `mcp_call_tool` attempts, one round of 4096 tokens
//! and 75 s of GPU that produced nothing at all, and a turn that recovered
//! only because the model eventually found the tool by itself.
//!
//! Three levers, and they compose into one story - a loop repeating itself is
//! told so, a round cannot outspend the turn, and a turn that runs out of
//! budget still ANSWERS instead of handing back the empty tail of a tool
//! round:
//!
//! 1. [`CallLedger`] - one record per turn of what has already run. A second
//!    identical call is answered from it; a third is refused.
//! 2. [`turn_output_cap`] and [`round_cap`] - the tool half of a turn is
//!    bounded as a whole, and no single round may spend past what is left.
//! 3. [`Stop`] + [`ANSWER_ONLY_NUDGE`] - when either bound is reached, one
//!    more round runs with the tools taken away and an instruction to answer.
//!
//! The caller gets a bound of their own on top: the Responses API's
//! `max_tool_calls` ([`CallLedger::with_limit`]) counts dispatched calls and
//! ends the tool half at the caller's number. It is the same machinery - the
//! ledger already sees every call, and reaching the limit is just a third
//! [`Stop`] into the same answer round, which is exactly the spec's own
//! reading of it ("further attempts to call a tool will be ignored").
//!
//! The shapes follow where the field landed. Vercel's AI SDK, when a
//! `stopWhen` condition fires while the model is still calling tools, makes
//! one more turn with `toolChoice:'none'` "so the run ends with a
//! natural-language answer instead of a half-finished tool call"; OpenRouter's
//! `stop_server_tools_when` says the same thing in its own words ("the model
//! is asked to produce its final answer with the context gathered so far");
//! and runtimes that fight stuck agents converge on a per-turn signature set
//! over (tool, canonical arguments) with a small repeat threshold. Ours
//! differs deliberately in one place: a repeat is ANSWERED from the ledger
//! before it is ever refused, because the second identical call is usually a
//! model that lost the result, not one that is stuck - and handing the result
//! back costs nothing and is very often what it actually wanted.
//!
//! Everything here is a decision plus the words for it. No dialect, no I/O:
//! the four runner loops (Responses × stream/non-stream, Anthropic ×
//! stream/non-stream) and both manager cloud lanes share this file, because
//! the unwrapping that unified had already drifted across three copies
//! and this is the same shape of thing.
