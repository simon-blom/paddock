//! GGML tensor types as they appear in GGUF files.
//!
//! IDs verified against ggml-org/llama.cpp master `ggml.h`
//! (GGML_TYPE_COUNT = 42; MXFP4 = 39, NVFP4 = 40). Unknown IDs are carried as
//! data, not errors - a newer file must not brick the parser, but anything we
//! can't size gets flagged instead of guessed.
//!
//! Two ids sit far outside that range on purpose: PrismML's ternary packings
//! (142, 143), private to their llama.cpp fork and numbered clear of upstream's
//! counter so the two can never collide. Layouts verified against the fork's
//! `ggml-common.h` (branch `prism`).

/// A tensor's storage type. `Unknown` keeps forward-compat: we can list and
/// route around tensors we can't execute yet.
