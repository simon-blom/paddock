//! Offline place lookup: two decimal degrees in, a name a person recognises out.
//!
//! Why. A photo's EXIF carries coordinates and nothing else, and a model handed
//! bare numbers does geography from memory. Measured on a real turn:
//! Qwen3.5-9B read `43.467448, 11.885127` as "the Piedmont region of northern
//! Italy" - it is Tuscany, 250 km away, and the nearest city is Arezzo at
//! 0.6 km. Everything else in that answer was sound; the one fact that came
//! from metadata was the one it invented. Resolving the point before it reaches
//! the prompt turns the guess into a fact.
//!
//! Why it is OFFLINE. Looking at your own photo must not tell anyone where you
//! were. A geocoding API would leak exactly the coordinate the user is asking
//! about, once per photo, silently - the thing this product says it does not
//! do. So the table ships in the binary: 170,756 places over ~1,000 people,
//! 3.5 MB packed down to 1.9 MB by zstd, decompressed once on first use.
//!
//! Why that TIER. GeoNames publishes the same data at three population floors.
//! Measured over 300 simulated rural photos: the coarse
//! cities15000 has a median error of 10.1 km and a p90 of 33 km, cities1000
//! 3.3 km and 8 km. A p90 of 33 km is a different valley - the exact mistake
//! this lookup exists to stop - so the extra 1.45 MB is bought deliberately.
//! The tiers agree wherever a photo sits near a large town; rural points are
//! where they part, and 77% of that sample got a different name.
//!
//! What it does not do. This is nearest-populated-place, not point-in-polygon,
//! so the REGION is the region of the city we matched, not a boundary test on
//! the point itself. Near a border those differ. The phrasing everywhere
//! therefore attributes the region to the city ("in Arezzo (Tuscany, Italy)")
//! and never claims the point is inside a region on its own authority, and
//! [`Place::distance_km`] is always available so a caller can say how far.
//!
//! Data: GeoNames, CC by 4.0 - see THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES. Regenerate with
//! `python the geodata generator`.
