//! The runner **admin surface** - the local control channel between a runner
//! and the manager.
//!
//! Transport is HTTP/1 over a **local-only** endpoint (the Docker precedent):
//! a Windows named pipe (`\\.\pipe\paddock-runner-<port>`, DACL = owning user
//! + SYSTEM only, `PIPE_REJECT_REMOTE_CLIENTS`) or a Unix domain socket
//!   (`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/paddock/runner-<port>.sock`, dir mode 0700). The OS *is*
//!   the authentication: same user => full admin, anyone else => can't connect.
//!   **This surface never binds TCP**, and inference API keys never grant admin
//!   ops - the separation is by transport, not policy.
//!
//! The wire contract is versioned (`WIRE_VERSION`) with a **v1-frozen core**:
//! identify + health + drain/shutdown never change shape, so any future
//! manager can recognize and cleanly stop any runner ever shipped. Everything
//! richer (stats, events) is capability-discovered via `identify`.
