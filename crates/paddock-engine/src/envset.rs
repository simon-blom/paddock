//! Engine-elected env defaults that the KERNEL PACK must also see.
//!
//! The pack's launchers read election/kill envs with C `getenv`. On Windows,
//! Rust's `std::env::set_var` writes the Win32 environment only - the UCRT
//! keeps its own copy, snapshotted at process start, and the pack DLL's
//! `getenv` reads that. So every default the engine elected at model load was
//! invisible to the pack on Windows: env-gated arms silently ran their
//! fallbacks, and the first launcher that REFUSES instead of falling back
//! (the DNC varlen rs route, engine gate true / pack gate false) surfaced it
//! as a bare CUDA 801 on every >=128-row qwen35 prefill span.
//!
//! `_putenv_s` updates the UCRT copy; both the exe and the nvcc-built pack
//! link the DYNAMIC ucrt (no crt-static in this workspace), so there is one
//! copy per process and both worlds agree after this. On non-Windows,
//! setenv/getenv already share one environ and set_var alone suffices.

/// `FOO=0` reverts" (see gemma4's LIN_KTZ). A bare presence check can't honor
