//! Platform IO for the T2 segment files - unbuffered, positioned,
//! and issued at DEPTH, with the per-device geometry MEASURED at open.
//!
//! The device probes established the facts this module exists for:
//!
//! 1. **Queue depth is a 10x lever on reads.** 256 KiB random: 1.19 GB/s at
//!    qd1, 11.88 at qd16. 4 MiB: 6.99 -> 15.5. A synchronous QD1 restore
//!    throws away ~90% of the device, which is the difference between a
//!    restore that beats recompute and one that loses to it.
//! 2. **Write bandwidth is the scarce side AND it degrades with chunk size**
//!    through the RAID driver measured here: 2.51 GB/s at 256 KiB, 0.81 at 4 MiB,
//!    0.66 at 16 MiB. The best write chunk is a *device* fact, not a
//!    universal one - so we measure it instead of electing it globally
//!    (per-device probing at store open is mandatory product
//!    behavior; the same machine offers a 15 GB/s tier and a 0.25 GB/s trap
//!    one drive letter apart).
//! 3. The probe reached those numbers with **thread-emulated depth over
//!    positioned unbuffered IO**, each worker holding its own handle. That
//!    detail is load-bearing: a Windows synchronous handle serializes IO in
//!    the kernel, so sharing one handle (or a `try_clone` of it) is depth 1
//!    wearing a costume.
//!
//! We ship exactly the technique that was measured. That is also why there is
//! no io_uring dependency: at 1-4 MiB chunks the submission-syscall cost is
//! microseconds against milliseconds of device time, so a ring would buy
//! latency we could not measure, at the price of a Linux-only dep and a
//! second code path. The [`Backend`] seam is narrow enough that a ring (or a
//! GDS direct path) drops in behind it if a later probe on real NVMe says
//! otherwise.
//!
//! Everything here is elected or measured - there is no user-facing knob, per
//! the no-customer-side-tuning rule.
