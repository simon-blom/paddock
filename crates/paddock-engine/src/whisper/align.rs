//! Backend-independent word-level timing from decoder cross-attention.
//!
//! Whisper has no frame-level emission head, so nothing in the model says when
//! a word was spoken - its `<|0.00|>` tokens are a 20 ms grid of segment
//! boundaries and stop there. What it does have is cross-attention: when the
//! decoder emits a token, some of its heads look at the encoder frames for the
//! audio at that moment. The times are therefore recovered, not computed.
//!
//! This module is the whole post-pass, and it is deliberately pure: given the
//! captured attention it returns a frame index per token, with no device and no
//! model in sight. That is what makes it testable against hand-worked cases.
//!
//! Pipeline (OpenAI `whisper/timing.py` is the reference; techniques studied
//! there and in whisper.cpp's `src/whisper.cpp`, implementation ours):
//!
//!   1. keep only the alignment heads - see the table below
//!   2. normalise each head over the token axis
//!   3. median-filter width 7 over the time axis (reflect padding)
//!   4. mean over heads, negate -> a cost matrix
//!   5. DTW with a monotonic path; the frame where the path enters a token is
//!      that token's start
//!
//! Step 5's monotonicity is the part that turns a noisy attention map into
//! something usable: tokens must go forward and time must go forward, so the
//! result is always a physically possible reading.
//!
//! Known ceiling, measured:
//! whisper's BPE puts the leading space inside the word token (only ~13% of
//! spaces reach the explicit space token), so a token spans silence and speech
//! and its boundary is smeared. Word starts therefore bias early, into the
//! preceding pause. Fixing that needs a retrained tokenizer, which is out of
//! scope; reporting these as tighter than they are is not.

/// One cross-attention head, as `(decoder layer, head)`.
