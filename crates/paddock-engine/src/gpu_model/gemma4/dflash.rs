//! Muse Glimmer's DFlash block-diffusion drafter.
//!
//! Meta ships a 2.6 B, 5-layer drafter next to the 30 B target. One drafter
//! forward drafts a whole block: rows = [last committed token, 15 x mask id
//! 201818] embedded through the TARGET's `token_embd`, five drafter layers
//! over a per-slot KV ring, the drafter's own final norm, then the TARGET's
//! `output.weight` and a device argmax. Rows 1.. are the drafts.
//!
//! What the drafter conditions on is the target's own middle: per layer it
//! reads a KV ring built from `z = enc_norm(fc(concat h_i))`, where `h_i` is
//! the target's residual stream ENTERING layers `dflash.target_layers` =
//! [2, 14, 26, 38, 50]. That index is the layer's INPUT (llama.cpp's
//! `t_layer_inp[il] = inpL`, muse-glimmer.cpp:85), so it equals the residual
//! LEAVING layers {1, 13, 25, 37, 49} - the same taps the model card lists.
//! Watch out: a +1 shift between the two spellings is silent corruption, but
//! that hazard belongs to laguna's safetensors drafter, whose
//! `aux_hidden_norms` this file's checkpoint does not have at all; here the
//! GGUF spelling and the card agree and there is nothing to shift.
//!
//! Reference for every line of the graph: llama.cpp `src/models/dflash.cpp`
//! (the non-DSpark arm) + `common/speculative.cpp`'s
//! `common_speculative_impl_draft_dflash`, read at the time. Study only -
//! this is our own implementation on our own kernels.
//!
//! Differences from `laguna/dflash.rs`, which is otherwise the template:
//!
//! - **Weights arrive as GGUF k-quant** (Q4_K bodies, Q6_K on `ffn_down` and
//!   `attn_v`), not bf16 safetensors, so there is no load-time quantize at
//!   all: every plane rides the existing W4A8 ladder exactly as the target's
//!   own k-quant models do. laguna had to host-quantize to Q8_0 first.
//! - **Split q/k/v planes** (the checkpoint ships them separately), qk
//!   RMSNorm, plain rope theta=500k, and **no per-head output gate** - the
//!   softplus gate is a laguna thing; this block is a plain Qwen3-style one.
//! - **The block is NON-CAUSAL**, which laguna's causal variant is not:
//!   `common/speculative.cpp` sets `llama_set_causal_attn(ctx_dft, false)`,
//!   so every noise row attends to every other row of its block. We get that
//!   from the attention bound the multimodal splice already uses - all 16
//!   rows carry bound `p + block - 1` while rope keeps true positions. Known
//!   deviation: our windowed kernels derive the SWA start from that same
//!   bound, so a row at p+i sees window start p+block-1-2047 instead of
//!   p+i-2047 - up to 15 of 2048 oldest keys, on drafts that are all
//!   target-verified anyway. Exact semantics need a second per-row position
//!   array in the prefill attention ABI; that is the SOTA target and is
//!   recorded rather than silently skipped.
//! - **No aux norms.** laguna norms each tap before the fusion; this
//!   checkpoint has no `aux_hidden_norms` and llama.cpp's loader has no
//!   mapping for them either - `fc` eats the raw concat.
//!
//! Fusion shape: `fc` is one [5*embd, embd] plane, and we split it at load
//! into five [embd, embd] bands (k-quant superblocks are position
//! independent, so a row-strip is a well-formed weight - `repack_kquant_bands`).
//! Each band is then consumed at its TAP, inside the layer walk, accumulating
//! into `zacc`. That is the whole reason the taps don't need a [rows,
//! 5*embd] staging plane: at 2 k rows that concat would be 545 MB of the
//! serving budget, and it would exist only to be read once.

/// One drafter GEMM, over whichever quant ladder actually covers this round's

///
///   * `mmq_pre_any` - the tick/decode ladder. Its k-quant arm has the
///     `kquant_gemm_mma_ks` K-split rung for `r <= 64` and then falls to
///     plain `dp4a` above it.
///   * `prefill_mm_pre_any` - the prefill ladder. Its k-quant arm reaches the
///     `w4a8_pipe2` double-buffered rung for `r > 64` and falls to
///     the same `dp4a` below it.
///
/// A draft round is `slots * (k + 1)` rows, which straddles 64 at around four

/// wide end on `dp4a`. Wiring only the tick ladder means every c8-and-wider
/// round runs the synchronous kernel while the round dutifully quantizes an
/// MMQ-layout activation plane that nothing reads.
///
/// INTERIM, and the gap is structural rather than in this function: the two
/// ladders should be one ladder that dispatches on width by itself, at which
/// point this collapses back to a single call. Splitting on `r` here is safe
/// for the drafter specifically - drafts are proposals the target's verify
/// re-derives, so a width-dependent rung moves acceptance, never output. The
/// same split would not be safe on a verify plane (see `mmq_pre`'s own note
