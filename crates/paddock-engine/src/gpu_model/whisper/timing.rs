//! Word timing, the device half: the teacher-forced pass that produces the
//! cross-attention `align` turns into times.
//!
//! `align` is pure and knows nothing about a GPU; this is everything it needs
//! fed to it. The split is deliberate - the maths is what can be wrong in
//! subtle ways and it is tested against hand-worked cases, while this file is
//! plumbing that either runs or does not.
//!
//! Why A SECOND pass at all. The decode already computed exactly this
//! attention, once per token, and threw it away. Keeping it would mean every
//! transcription materialising an attention row per alignment head per step -
//! and a second captured graph variant to write it - to serve a feature most
//! requests never ask for. So word timing re-runs the decode instead, with the
//! tokens it already produced fed back in (teacher forcing), which is also what
//! both references do.
//!
//! AND the RE-RUN is A PREFILL, not A DECODE. Teacher forcing knows every input
//! up front, so the whole sequence can go through in CHUNKS of rows rather than
//! one token at a time - which matters because whisper decode at one row is
//! purely weight-bandwidth-bound (measured: 4.7 ms a step, and the model is
//! 3.1 GB at f16 on a ~700 GB/s card), so a chunk of rows costs barely more
//! than one row. Measured on a 145-token window: 959 ms token-at-a-time,
//! 120 ms at 32 rows a chunk. Both references do the same thing - one forward
//! pass over the full sequence. The chunk is bounded rather than being the
//! whole sequence because cross-attention re-reads the encoder planes per ROW;
//! see `CHUNK_ROWS`.
//!
//! Causality across a chunk is not an extra mechanism: `whisper_qkv_split`
//! writes every row's K/V into the slot at its own position before
//! `whisper_dec_attn` runs, and the attention reads keys `0..=pos` per row - so
//! a row never sees a later row's key even though it is already in the cache.
//!
//! The ROW OFF-BY-ONE, which is the part that is easy to get wrong. The
//! attention at input position *i* is the model reading the audio in order to
//! emit token *i+1*. So the row captured while feeding `<|notimestamps|>` is
//! the boundary before the first text token, the row captured while feeding
//! text token *j* is the boundary before token *j+1*, and the row for the last
//! text token is the end of the transcript. `n` text tokens therefore give
//! `n+1` BOUNDARIES, not `n` starts, and token *j* spans `[b[j], b[j+1])`.
//! Both OpenAI (`timing.py`, slicing `[len(sot_sequence) : -1]`) and
//! whisper.cpp (`whisper_exp_compute_token_level_timestamps_dtw`, dropping
//! `sot_sequence_length` from the front and one from the back) land on exactly
//! this row set; they differ only in whether the task token is in the prompt at
//! all, and we keep it because it is in the prompt the transcript was actually
//! decoded under.
//!
//! Because the trailing `<|endoftext|>` row is discarded by both references, we
//! never feed it - the sequence run here is precisely the decode's own prompt
//! plus its own text tokens.
