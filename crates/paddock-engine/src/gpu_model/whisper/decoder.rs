//! Whisper decoder - batched greedy transcription over decode SLOTS
//! (bring-up - the serving lane). Reference: transformers
//! `WhisperDecoder`; vLLM `models/whisper.py` is the serving cross-reference
//! and its prompt construction is what this matches exactly.
//!
//! Per decoder layer, in order:
//!   LN -> self-attention (causal, over the ≤448 tokens decoded so far)
//!     -> +res
//!   LN -> CROSS-attention over the encoder window -> +res
//!   LN -> fc1 -> GELU-erf -> fc2 -> +res
//! then a final LN and the `proj_out` head.
//!
//! Cross-attention is the mechanism no other served family has, and its
//! shape is what makes it cheap: K and V come from the ENCODER states (no LN,
//! no position, no causality) and are therefore computed once per window and
//! static for the whole decode. `encode_into` precomputes both planes per
//! layer straight into the slot's f16 cache; each decode step is then two
//! single-query attentions over f16 K/V - `whisper_dec_attn`, one kernel for
//! both, per-slot key lengths and a flash-decoding key split.
//!
//! Everything is BATCHED over ROWS. `x`, `q`, the logits - all compact
//! `[batch, ...]` in ACTIVE order; the K/V planes are `[cap, stride, d]`
//! addressed through a `slots` index vector, so a slot that finishes leaves
//! the active set without any cache moving. `pos`, the fed token and the slot
//! id are device-resident vectors uploaded per step, which is also what keeps
//! the step free of per-slot host branching.
//!
//! ROWS are not SLOTS, and the indirection through `slots` is what makes them
//! separable: serving runs one row per slot, but nothing in the tick requires
//! that, and the word-timing pass runs a chunk of rows on one slot at
//! consecutive positions - a prefill in all but name. `Scratch` is sized by
//! rows, the KV planes by slots.
//!
//! Prompting follows the checkpoint's decode contract, ids read from the
//! file rather than assumed: `<|startoftranscript|><|{lang}|><|transcribe|>
//! <|notimestamps|>`, then greedy tokens until `<|endoftext|>`. vLLM builds
//! the identical string (`whisper.py get_generation_prompt`) and applies no
//! logit suppression on top - audited, so neither do we; the HF generation
//! config's `suppress_tokens` would be a divergence from the reference, not a
//! fidelity gain.
//!
//! KV precision: `kv_dtype`, f16 by default and fp8-e4m3 under
//! `--kv-cache-dtype fp8_e4m3`. f16 is the reference's own class (vLLM serves
//! whisper at `--dtype float16` and its KV cache follows the model dtype),
//! and it already halved what the cross planes cost - they were 491 MB per
//! window at f32.
//!
//! The fp8 arm exists because whisper's cross planes are unlike any other
//! family's KV: 1500 encoder frames per slot per layer, static for the whole
//! decode and never shorter than the full window, so a c32 step reads
//! 32 slots x 32 layers x 1500 x 1280 x 2 planes = 7.9 GB per TOKEN. That one
//! kernel measured 27% of all GPU time in a c32 battery, running at the
//! card's achievable read bandwidth - element width is the only lever on it.
//! Both caches are BYTE planes sized `elems * kv_dtype.bytes()`, the shape
//! every other family's cache already has.
