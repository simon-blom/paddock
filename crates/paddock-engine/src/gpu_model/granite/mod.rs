//! IBM Granite 4.1 (3b / 8b / 30b) - a plain dense llama-class family.
//!
//! Architecture, verified against a real official `granite-4.1-8b-Q8_0.gguf`
//! metadata dump (llama.cpp `src/models/granite.cpp` is the
//! study reference):
//!
//! - dense, full attention on every layer - no SWA, no hybrid, no MoE, no
//!   QK-norm, no attention sinks, no biases anywhere;
//! - GQA 32 q / 8 kv heads over head_dim 128, SwiGLU FFN, RMSNorm;
//! - rope theta 1e7, full rotary (`rope.dimension_count` == head_dim), no
//!   rope scaling.
//!
//! The only structural delta from a llama-style dense stack is four scalar
//! multipliers, all of which fail silently if missed - the model keeps
//! producing fluent text, just wrong text - which is exactly why the
//! same-weights greedy oracle is the acceptance gate:
//!
//! ```text
//! embd  = tok_embd[t] · embedding_scale                 (12.0)
//! layer:  h = x + residual_scale · Attn(RMSNorm(x))     (0.22)
//!         x = h + residual_scale · SwiGLU(RMSNorm(h))   (0.22)
//! head:   logits = (lm_head · RMSNorm(x)) / logit_scale (16.0)
//! ```
//!
//! plus `attention_scale` (0.0078125) used as the KQ scale in place of
//! 1/sqrt(head_dim). Note 0.0078125 is 1/128 = 1/head_dim, not 1/sqrt(128)
//! ≈ 0.0884 - close enough to a plausible default to slip through review,
//! far enough to wreck the logits.
//!
//! ROPE CONVENTION: granite is llama.cpp's `LLAMA_ROPE_TYPE_NORM` - rotating
//! INTERLEAVED pairs `(2k, 2k+1)` - while every other family we serve is NEOX
//! (half-split `(k, k+half)`). Wrong convention = fluent, confidently wrong
//! text, no error. The pack's rope kernel is templated on the convention and
//! granite calls `rope_yarn_batch_norm`; weights stay in file order. That is
//! how llama.cpp (separate `rope_norm` / `rope_neox` kernels) and vLLM (an
//! `IS_NEOX` template arg) both do it, and it costs the NEOX families nothing
//! since the instantiations are separate compiled kernels.
//!
//! Rejected alternative, recorded so nobody re-derives it: un-permuting q/k
//! rows at load so NEOX rope would "just work". It is exact for Q8_0 (row
//! reorder, blocks run along in_dim) and needs no kernel - but it only has a
//! bytes-level repack seam for Q8_0, so Q4_K_M (the quant most people run)
//! would have needed extra plumbing; it breaks the invariant that resident
//! weights match file bytes, which any later fused-QKV / W4A8-repack / TP
//! sharding path would trip over silently; and it makes intermediate-tensor
//! comparison against the parity oracle read permuted.
//!
//! Shapes are read from the file, never hard-coded: the same code serves 3b
//! (32 layers), 8b (40) and 30b (64 layers, ff 32768) - the 4.1 sizes differ
//! only in depth and FFN width.
//!
//! PLAIN `llama` FILES ride this family too (2026-09-22, MiniCPM5-2B first):
//! granite IS the llama stack plus the four scalars, which is how llama.cpp
//! defines it as well, so a `general.architecture = llama` file loads here
//! with every multiplier at identity (attention at 1/sqrt(head_dim)) and the
//! same NORM rope. The loader is the gate on what "llama" means: no rope
//! scaling (Llama 3.1's `rope_freqs` included), no attention biases, full
//! rotary, a pre-tokenizer we carry - anything else refuses by name instead
//! of serving a different model fluently.
