//! Paged KV pool - the block allocator + per-sequence block tables that decouple
//! KV memory from `max_ctx × max_batch`. See.
//!
//! **P1 (this module) is the CPU-side bookkeeping only:** which physical block
//! backs which `(sequence, logical position)`, a free-list + refcount so a block
//! shared by several sequences / radix nodes is freed only at refcount 0,
//! copy-on-write for zero-copy prefix sharing, and a sliding ring for windowed
//! (SWA) layers whose allocation is capped at the window instead of `max_ctx`.
//!
//! It owns **no device memory** and touches no kernel - a `BlockId` is just an
//! index into the per-layer `[n_blocks, BLOCK_TOKENS, kv_dim]` GPU store that P2
//! adds, and the paged attention kernels that read that store land in P2+. Keeping
//! this layer pure makes the allocator fully unit-testable before any GPU work,
//! which is where subtle refcount/CoW/ring bugs would otherwise hide.
