//! Transcription serving seam: a dedicated thread owning a native Whisper and
//! scheduling many transcriptions across its decode slots.
//!
//! Mirrors `Encoder`'s thread-owns-the-device shape - whisper is an
//! encoder-DECODER, which does not fit the `Generator` trait the decoder-only
//! families share: there is no prompt KV to page, no continuous batch to join
//! in the LLM sense, and the audio is the whole input.
//!
//! SCHEDULING (the bring-up lane was one clip at a time, FIFO,
//! which pinned throughput flat at ~2.1 req/s from c1 to c32 while latency
//! grew linearly - the queue was the engine). The unit of work here is a
//! 30 s WINDOW, not a request: whisper's encoder is fixed-size, so a long
//! clip is several windows, and windows are what occupy slots. Each loop
//! turn:
//!
//!   1. drain newly arrived jobs (blocking only when nothing is in flight),
//!   2. fill every free slot by ENCODING one admittable window into it,
//!   3. run one decode step across every active slot at once,
//!   4. retire slots that hit `<|endoftext|>` (or a limit) - running the word
//!      timing pass first, while the slot still holds that window's encoder
//!      planes - and answer any request whose windows are all in.
//!
//! Admission has exactly one ordering constraint, and it is a correctness
//! one: when the caller did not force a language, window 0 must resolve it
//! before its siblings start, because whisper detects per window and a
//! mid-clip flip is a transcript bug, not multilingual support. With a
//! forced language - what every benchmark and most callers do - all of a
//! clip's windows are independent and admit together.
//!
//! The mel frontend is not here: jobs arrive with their windows already
//! transformed, computed on the caller's blocking pool. Host DSP on this
//! thread would serialize every concurrent transcription behind each other's
//! frontend, which is the same defect the Qwen3-ASR path already fixed.
