//! Zero-copy radix prefix cache over the paged `KvPool` (P5c).
//!
//! **This module is the CPU-side bookkeeping only** (the same discipline as
//! `kv_pool` / P1): it maps block-aligned token prefixes to `KvPool` block ids so
//! a new sequence that shares a prefix ADOPTS the cached blocks (refcount++, via
//! [`crate::kv_pool::BlockTable::share_prefix`]) instead of recomputing or copying
//! them. It owns no device memory and touches no kernel - the blocks it names are
//! the same `KvPool` blocks the slots write, which is the whole point of
//! zero-copy sharing (vs. `prefix_cache::RadixKvCache`, which keeps its own store
//! and COPIES).
//!
//! Refcount lifecycle (all through `KvPool`):
//! - `insert` RETAINS each new cached block -> the tree holds one reference.
//! - a sharing slot RETAINS via `BlockTable::share_prefix` -> +1 per slot.
//! - a slot finishing RELEASES via `BlockTable::clear` (free-on-completion, P5b).
//! - [`PagedRadix::evict_lru`] RELEASES the tree's reference on the LRU leaf.
//! - a block returns to the free-list only at refcount 0 (no tree node, no slot).
//!
//! Only **full 16-token blocks** are cached: a block-aligned prefix means the
//! adopting slot never writes into a shared block (its own writes start at the
//! next block boundary), so **no copy-on-write is needed** for this path. The
//! token-granular partial-tail reuse (needs `BlockTable::cow_at`) and the DeltaNet
//! recurrent-state checkpoints (hybrid resume) are the device-wiring follow-up
//! (P5c-P2); this module is the allocator/tree bookkeeping they build on.
